### Python Scripts    
These scripts are a mix of 'run it when you want it' and automated 'make life easier' scripts.    

#### downloads_sorter
This script will automatically create folders in your downloads folder for each file extention in there and wrangle the files into the relevant folder. Modify line 3 to be your downloads folder.    
To make this most effective, I've placed a copy in my Windows startup path. Run -> shell:startup -> Copy into this folder.     
Your downloads auto-sort every time you turn on your computer.
